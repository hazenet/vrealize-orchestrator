# For In Loop

The For In Loop is identical to the functionallity achieved by the For Loop written in Code Example LB5DB2.

```javascript
// vms being a array of VMs

for (i in vms){
    // Do stuff for each other object here
    System.log(vms[i].name);
}
```
_Code Example LO9BQZ_

So it is a simpler and more readable way of doing a simple loop for each object in a array.
