## Origin {#origin}

The software was originally developed by Dunes Technologies and called "Virtual Services - Orchestrator", shortned to either VS-O or VSO. The VSO name is still seen in some file names, both in the server and client part. VMware annoucned that they bought Dunes Technologies on September 11, 2007. With vSphere 4 and vCenter Server 4, the Orchestrator software was now included in the installation and licensing of vCenter Server 4. The product was now called vCenter Orchestrator, shortned to vCO. That name is still very widely used in URLs, file names and orther products by VMware.

At VMworld 2014 in Barcelona VMware choose to do a name change on several products, include Orchestrator. This resulted in the name we now today, vRealize Orchestrator.
