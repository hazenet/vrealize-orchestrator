# What is vRealize Orchestrator

vRealize Orchestrator is a Client-Server based workflow engine. It allows VMware administrators and IT professionals to automate tasks across the datacenter. The engine is plugin based and comes preloaded with a bunch of extensions for components such as vCenter Server, Active Directory, SQL etc. There are over 200 predefined workflows only as part of the vCenter Server plugin. A workflow can be included in other workflows or run separately. The main tool for interaction with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) is the vRO client. It's java based standalone application available for multiple operating systems. It serves as a graphical user interface (GUI) to create, run and manage workflows.
