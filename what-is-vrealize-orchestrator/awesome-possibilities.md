# Awesome possibilities

Thanks to its architecture, vRealize Orchestrator can be easily integrated with many different components in your virtual infrastructure and beyond it. There are plugins allowing you to connect to server systems, storage systems, network devices, cloud providers and more. In the built-in functionality of the product are included plugins for communication with SOAP and REST based APIs. All this creates the possibility to orchestrate tasks across different areas in your datacenter from one single tool. This is a huge advantage as you can control all dependencies and infrastructure automation requirements from one view.

vRO can be configured to operate in clustered mode. This functionality helps vRO to meet the high-availability requirements in an enterprise level IT environment. We will cover this in more details later in this book.
