## Looping {#looping}

### For Loop {#for-loop}

This is the most flexible looping style in Javascript, not the easiest to write or remember.

```
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    // do stuff
}
```

The "For" loop has 3 statements:

1. "i = 0"
   Statement 1 is normally used to initialize the iterator variable used in the loop, but it's possible to initialize multiple variables, by seperating them with a comma.  

```
for (i = 0, otherVariable = "something"; i < 10; i++){
    // do stuff
}
```
   Or Statement 1 can be completly omitted, if the iterator variable has been initialized else where in the script

```
var i = 0;
for (; i < 10; i++){
    // do stuff
}
```

To explain, 'i' in this case is the iterator, but it's just a variable, so anything can be used.

### For In Loop {#for-in-loop}

### For Each In Loop {#for-each-in-loop}

### While Loop {#while-loop}

### Do While Loop {#do-while-loop}

### Break Statement {#break-statement}

### Continue Statement {#continue-statement}

## Try {#try}
